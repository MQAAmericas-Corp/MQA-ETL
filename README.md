# ETL-MQA
## Extract Transform Load Library
 The library is designed for data transformation, data cleansing, extraction and loading. It is built on top of frameworks of data science and ETL such as NumPY, PANDAS and Luigi.

For more information on the core frameworks:

**PANDAS:** https://pandas.pydata.org

**NumPy:** https://numpy.org

**Luigi:** https://luigi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

 The code base and usage structure is dived into two parts. The Comma separated values file handler in one file (ETLcsv.py) and the second part relates to the DB connection and management for this extraction (ETLdb).
 
 The first part is under development and the second hasn't started yet. Under the library umbrella is forecasted to exist tailored connector for OnBase API.
